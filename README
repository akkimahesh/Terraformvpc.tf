Ìø† VPC Creation
You start by creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which is your isolated virtual network in the cloud. It has its own IP address range (CIDR block) that defines the size of the network.

Ì≥¶ Subnets Creation
Inside the VPC, you create subnets. These are like separate sections or rooms inside your network:

A public subnet (ÔøΩÔøΩÌºê) is where resources can connect directly to the internet.

A private subnet (Ì≥¶Ì¥í) is isolated from the internet and typically used for backend resources.

Ìºê Internet Gateway (IGW)
An Internet Gateway (Ìºê) is attached to the VPC to allow communication between the public subnet and the internet ‚Äî it acts like the main entrance door.

Ì∫ß Route Tables and Associations

A route table (Ì∫ß) contains rules that direct traffic from subnets to the right destination (internet, NAT, or local subnet).

The public subnet is associated with a route table that sends all outbound internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway (Ìºê).

The private subnet has a different route table, which directs outbound internet traffic through a NAT Gateway (Ì¥Å) instead of the Internet Gateway.

Ìºç Elastic IP (EIP)
An Elastic IP (Ìºç) is a static public IP address reserved for your account. It‚Äôs attached to the NAT Gateway to give it a consistent internet-facing IP.

Ì¥Å NAT Gateway
A NAT Gateway (Ì¥Å) sits in the public subnet and enables resources in the private subnet to access the internet for updates or downloads, while keeping them unreachable from the outside.

Ì¥ó Route Table Associations
Each subnet is linked to its corresponding route table, ensuring that:

Public subnet traffic goes directly to the internet (via IGW).

Private subnet traffic goes through the NAT Gateway for secure internet access.
